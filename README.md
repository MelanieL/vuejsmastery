# Vue.js - Intro to Vue.js

Vue Mastery has a free weekend happening (Feb 22 - Feb 24 2019), so I've decided to take a look since I've been curious about Vue.js for a while.

I'm posting my exercises (1 through 11) from the "Intro to Vue.js" course along with my notes.

If you're interested in taking any of their courses, the site is: https://www.vuemastery.com/

Enjoy!
